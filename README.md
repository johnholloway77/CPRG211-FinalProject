Program Description:

Gym Management System

This program is designed to connect with an online database, in this case a MySql server hosted online at https://johnholloway.ca, present the existing records to the user, and update the records in real time but automatically pushing information to the database via SQL queries - does not require the user to click on a "Save file" button or anything.

Program requires an active internet connection as database is not stored locally.
